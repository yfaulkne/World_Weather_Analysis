# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
##### The purpose of this project was to create a Beta version of an app to help users plan trips. There were three deliverables for this project.
#####
Deliverable 1: 
* Retrieve weather data from 2000 different latitiudes and longitudes across the world. These geographical points were then added to a database to work with and find nearby habitable cities for potential travel destinations. 
#####
Deliverable 2:
* From the list of destinations in deleiverable one, the user can input minimum and maximum weather parameters to narrow down their search. From there, they can choose four different cities to travel to.
